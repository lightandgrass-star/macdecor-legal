# **MacDecor**

# **Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** [Your App Launch Date]

### **1. Our Privacy Promise**

Welcome to MacDecor! Our app helps you personalize your Mac with beautiful wallpapers and folder icons. This Privacy Policy explains, in simple terms, what information the app *needs* to work, what it *doesn't* collect, and how your data is protected.

### **2. What Information MacDecor Uses (and What it Ignores)**

We built MacDecor to be private from the ground up. Our goal is to *never* collect personal information that can identify you.

**What MacDecor Will NEVER Ask For:**

* Your name, email, or phone number.
* Your location, contacts list, or calendars.
* Your browsing history or other apps' data.

#### **A. Information the App Needs to Work**

To remember your preferences and purchases, MacDecor needs to save some data. This data stays entirely within your control. This includes:

* **Your Purchased Themes:** A record of which Theme packs you've purchased (managed by Apple's App Store).
* **Your Preferences:** Your selected wallpapers and any app settings you've customized.
* **Folder Bookmarks:** Secure references to folders where you've applied custom icons (no folder contents, just locations).

**Here's the most important part:** This data is saved in **two places only**:

1. **On your device** (your Mac).
2. **In your personal Apple iCloud account** (this is how your purchases and preferences sync between your Macs).

**We, the developers of MacDecor, cannot see, read, or access any of this data.** It is never sent to our servers.

#### **B. Folder Access (Only With Your Permission)**

MacDecor offers a feature that lets you apply custom folder icons to folders on your Mac. To make this work, the app **must** ask for your permission to access specific folders you choose.

**Our Commitment to You on This:**

1. **You are in complete control.** MacDecor will *never* access any folder unless you explicitly select it for icon customization.
2. **Limited access only.** The app only modifies the folder's icon—it does not access, read, or modify any files within your folders.
3. **Secure bookmarks.** MacDecor uses Apple's security-scoped bookmarks to remember your folder selections. These bookmarks only allow icon modification, nothing else.
4. **It stays private.** The folder locations you select are stored only on your device and in your iCloud, where we can't see them.
5. **Revocable access.** You can revoke folder access at any time through macOS System Settings > Privacy & Security.

### **3. How We Use Your Information**

We only use your data to make the app function for you.

* **To make the app work:** We use your saved preferences to apply your chosen wallpapers and remember your settings.
* **To sync your purchases:** We use your Apple ID (managed by Apple, not us) to sync your Theme purchases across your Mac devices.
* **To sync your preferences:** We use your private iCloud (CloudKit) so your selected wallpapers and folder icon settings are available on all your Macs.
* **To apply folder icons:** With your permission, we use folder access to apply the custom icons you select.

### **4. Sharing Your Information (We Don't)**

**We do not share or sell your information.**

We don't have your personal information, so we couldn't share it even if we wanted to. We (the developers) cannot see your purchases, preferences, or folder selections.

This app **does not** use any third-party analytics (like Google Analytics) or advertising tools. Your activity in MacDecor is for your eyes only.

### **5. Your Data Rights (You're in Charge)**

You have complete control over your data.

* **Right to Access:** You can see your preferences and purchased Themes anytime just by using the app.
* **Right to Revoke Consent:** You can change your mind about folder access at any time through macOS System Settings > Privacy & Security > Files and Folders, and toggle MacDecor's access off.
* **Right to Deletion:** You can delete all your MacDecor data by:
  - Deleting the app from your Mac (this removes local data).
  - Managing your iCloud data through your Apple ID settings.
  - Your purchase history is managed by Apple and follows Apple's policies.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination:** We will never limit the app's features or treat you differently for exercising your privacy rights.

For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.

### **6. Children's Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K)**

MacDecor is not designed for or directed at children under 13 (in the United States) or 16 (in the European Union). We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

### **7. How We Keep Your Data Safe**

We rely on the powerful security built into the macOS operating system and Apple's encrypted CloudKit service. By keeping your data on-device and in your own iCloud, it's protected by the industry-leading security that Apple provides.

**Additional Security Measures:**

* Theme content is stored with encryption to protect your purchases.
* Folder bookmarks use Apple's security-scoped technology to limit access to only what's necessary.
* All data transmission between your device and iCloud uses Apple's end-to-end encryption.

### **8. Data Retention**

Your data is retained:

* **On your device:** Until you delete the app or manually clear app data.
* **In your iCloud:** According to your iCloud storage settings, until you delete it.
* **Purchase records:** Managed by Apple indefinitely to support purchase restoration.

We (the developers) do not retain any of your data because we never have access to it in the first place.

### **9. International Data Transfers**

If you use MacDecor outside your country of residence, your data may be stored in Apple's iCloud servers in various regions. Apple maintains industry-standard protections for international data transfers, including compliance with GDPR requirements.

### **10. Changes to This Policy**

If we ever need to update this policy, we will let you know through the app or by posting the new policy here. Your continued use of MacDecor after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.

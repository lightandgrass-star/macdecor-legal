# **Terms of Use**

**Effective Date:** [Your App Launch Date]

### **1. Your Agreement to These Terms**

Welcome to MacDecor. These Terms of Use ("Terms") are a binding contract between you and **[Your Developer Name or Company Name]** ("we," "us," or "our").

These Terms govern your access to and use of the MacDecor macOS application (the "App") and any of its related services.

**By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our [Privacy Policy]([Link to your Privacy Policy])**. If you do not agree to all of these terms, you do not have permission to use our App.

### **2. The MacDecor Service**

MacDecor is a desktop customization tool that allows you to personalize your Mac with beautifully designed wallpapers and folder icons. The App provides a curated collection of themed design sets ("Themes"), each containing high-resolution wallpapers optimized for Mac displays and matching folder icon packs.

You can browse and preview all Themes within the App. To apply and use the full-resolution wallpapers and folder icons, you must purchase the Theme through an In-App Purchase.

### **3. Your Privacy & Your Data**

Your privacy is fundamental to MacDecor. As explained in detail in our **[Privacy Policy]([Link to your Privacy Policy])**, your data (such as your purchased Themes and preferences) is stored only on your device and in your personal iCloud account. **We do not see it, collect it, or share it.**

The App requires permission to access certain folders on your Mac when you choose to apply folder icons. This access is limited to the specific folders you select and is only used to apply the custom icons you choose.

### **4. Your License to Use MacDecor**

As long as you comply with these Terms, we grant you a **limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license** to download and install a copy of the App on Mac devices that you own or control, and to use the App for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.

### **5. In-App Purchases**

MacDecor offers individual Theme packs for purchase ("In-App Purchases").

* All In-App Purchases are processed through the Apple App Store and are subject to Apple's own terms and conditions.
* We do not have access to or control over your payment information.
* Each Theme is a one-time purchase that unlocks permanent access to that Theme's content across all your Mac devices logged into the same Apple ID.
* You can restore your purchases on any Mac device by logging in with the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.
* Unless otherwise required by law, all In-App Purchases are final and non-refundable.

### **6. Intellectual Property**

**Our Property:** The App and all its contents—including all Themes, wallpapers, folder icons, artwork, designs, text, and software (our "Content")—are the exclusive property of **[Your Developer Name]** and its licensors, protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

**Your Use:** When you purchase a Theme:
* You receive a personal, non-transferable license to use the wallpapers and folder icons on your own Mac devices.
* You may not redistribute, resell, sublicense, or share the purchased content with others.
* You may not use the content for commercial purposes or public display beyond your personal devices.
* We retain all ownership rights to the underlying designs and artwork.

### **7. Restrictions (How to Use MacDecor Fairly)**

You agree not to do any of the following:

* Use the App or its content for any commercial purpose or illegal activity.
* Copy, modify, reverse-engineer, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.
* Share, sell, rent, lease, or sublicense the App, your account, or purchased Themes with others.
* Use any automated means (bots, scripts) to interact with the App or attempt to bypass the purchase system.
* Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices.
* Redistribute or publicly share the wallpapers or icons obtained through the App.

### **8. File System Access**

MacDecor requires access to specific folders on your Mac to apply custom folder icons. By using this feature:

* You grant the App permission to modify folder icons only for folders you explicitly select.
* The App uses macOS security-scoped bookmarks to remember your folder selections.
* You can revoke folder access at any time through macOS System Settings.
* The App does not access, read, or modify any files within your folders—only the folder icons themselves.

### **9. Disclaimer of Warranties (The "As-Is" Clause)**

The App is provided to you **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE,"** without warranty of any kind. We do not promise that the App will be perfect, uninterrupted, error-free, or that it will meet all of your requirements. You use it at your own risk.

We do not guarantee compatibility with all macOS versions or system configurations, though we make reasonable efforts to support current and recent macOS versions.

### **10. Limitation of Liability (Our Responsibility is Limited)**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, **[Your Developer Name]** (and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents) **will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues,** arising from your use of (or inability to use) the App, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Our total liability to you for any and all claims related to the App will not exceed the amount you paid us for the App or In-App Purchases (if any) in the 12 months preceding the claim.

### **11. Termination**

You can stop using the App and terminate these Terms at any time by deleting the App from your device.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App, or to modify or discontinue the App, at any time for any reason, with or without notice.

### **12. Changes to These Terms**

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make a significant change, we will notify you through the App or by other means. If you continue to use the App after the changes take effect, you agree to the new Terms.

### **13. Governing Law**

These Terms are governed by the laws of **[Your Country/State]**, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
